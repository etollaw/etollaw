## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Eldad Workeneh Tolla!
I'm a CS and Math major with minors in Data Science and Engineering at Randolph College. Originally from Ethiopia, I have a strong passion for exploring the intersection of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies. My projects often reflect my curiosity and dedication to turning complex problems into innovative solutions. I'm building voice-controlled systems and diving into data-driven research, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
